# 3D-renderer

This program renders schematics that consist of points, lines and triangles in 3D space. 

To run the program, please run hullMain.py.

Each schematic can have its own color settings and an algorithm in a python file to define its structure, i.e. where all of its elements are in 3D space. The camera automatically orbits around the origin, (0, 0, 0), displaying everything there is to see in the schematic.

The preferences of color, point size, and other features of the schematics rendered can all be changed by editing the schematicLab.py file.
